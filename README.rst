1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
The radcli library is a library for writing RADIUS Clients. The library's
approach is to allow writing RADIUS-aware application in less than 50 lines
of C code. It was based originally on freeradius-client and radiusclient-ng
and is source compatible with them.


2. Background
-------------

For the development of the openconnect VPN server, I needed a simple library to
allow using radius for authentication and accounting without having to understand
the internals of radius. Such library was the freeradius-client library, but
was undocumented, had too much legacy code centered around radlogin, a tool 
which is of no significance today, was IPv4-only and had no releases for
several years.

This library addresses these shortcomings, adds package management via
pkg-config, adds support for TCP, TLS and DTLS, provides documentation of the API,
and will include any new features for the task. It is provided as a shared
library in case it is useful to other projects as well, and is also made source
compatible with radiusclient-ng and freeradius-client.
